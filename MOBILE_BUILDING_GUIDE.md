# Building the Brawl Stars Auto Dodge APK on Your Android Phone

This guide explains how to attempt building the Brawl Stars Auto Dodge APK directly on your Android phone using AIDE (Android IDE).

## Warning

This is an advanced process and might not fully work due to the complexity of the app (OpenCV integration, accessibility services). The free version of AIDE has limitations, and the complete app may require the premium version.

## Prerequisites

1. An Android phone with at least 2GB of RAM
2. At least 1GB of free storage space
3. AIDE - Android IDE app installed from the Google Play Store
4. A file manager app with zip extraction capabilities
5. Patience and willingness to troubleshoot issues

## Step 1: Install AIDE and Set Up

1. Install [AIDE - Android IDE](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aide.ui) from the Google Play Store
2. Open AIDE and follow the initial setup instructions
3. If prompted, install any additional packages it requests

## Step 2: Download and Extract the Project Files

1. Download the Brawl Stars Auto Dodge project files from Replit:
   - In the Replit project, click the three dots menu at the top
   - Select "Download as zip"
   - Save the zip file to your phone

2. Extract the zip file:
   - Open your file manager app
   - Navigate to the downloaded zip file
   - Extract it to a location you can easily find (e.g., a folder named "BrawlStarsAutoDodge")

## Step 3: Import the Project in AIDE

1. Open AIDE
2. Tap the menu icon (three horizontal lines) in the top-left corner
3. Select "Open Android App Project"
4. Navigate to where you extracted the project files
5. Select the main project folder

## Step 4: Resolve Dependencies

The app uses OpenCV which might be challenging to set up in AIDE:

1. In AIDE, go to "App Settings" > "Dependencies"
2. Tap "Add Library" and search for "opencv-android"
3. If available, add it to your project
4. If not available, you might need to download the OpenCV Android SDK separately and import it manually (this is a complex process on a phone)

## Step 5: Build the App

1. After importing the project and resolving dependencies, tap the "Run" button (play icon)
2. AIDE will attempt to compile the app
3. If it encounters errors, it will show them in the error panel
4. Try to resolve any errors that appear (this might be challenging for complex libraries)

## Step 6: Install the APK

If the build is successful:

1. AIDE will automatically install the app on your phone
2. You'll need to grant installation permissions if prompted
3. The app should appear in your app drawer

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Failed to resolve dependencies"**: AIDE might not be able to automatically download all dependencies. You might need to find and download them manually.

2. **OpenCV integration issues**: The OpenCV library is complex and might not properly integrate in AIDE. This is a significant potential roadblock.

3. **Out of memory errors**: Building large projects on phones can sometimes exceed available memory.

4. **"Unsupported Gradle version"**: AIDE might not support the Gradle version used in the project. You might need to modify build files to use a compatible version.

### Alternatives if AIDE Doesn't Work:

1. **Try an online Android build service**: Some websites allow you to upload project files and build APKs online.

2. **Use a cloud-based development environment**: Some services offer virtual computers you can access from your phone to run development tools.

3. **Ask someone with a computer to build it for you**: This remains the most reliable option.

## Conclusion

Building complex Android apps directly on a phone is challenging and has many limitations. While AIDE is a powerful tool, it may not be able to handle all the dependencies and features of the Brawl Stars Auto Dodge app. Be prepared for potential issues that might not be solvable without a computer development environment.
